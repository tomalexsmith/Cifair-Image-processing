Conducting Comparative Analysis of CNN Architectures Trained on the CiFair10 Dataset

This GitHub repository presents a study that focuses on comparing the performance and results obtained from various popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including AlexNet, LeNet, and VGGNet. Through training these architectures on the CiFair10 dataset, this project aims to provide insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses. By leveraging the results obtained from evaluating and comparing existing architectures, this project introduces a custom CNN model that strives to outperform the initial architectures. With the goal of achieving superior results, this research-driven development enhances the capabilities of CNNs for specific tasks.
